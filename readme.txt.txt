Dear staff at Codecademy:

I completed code in the learning environment of Codecademy.  

However, when I copied and pasted the codes, line by line, some codes yielded errors in my Jupiter notebook, not the learning environment.  

I think the problem occurred in "Step 4", specifically, when define "category_counts" vesus "category_count".  

While I was in the environment, all codes worked.  

Thank you!
